# Contributing to this project

Please take a moment to review this document in order to make the contribution process easy and effective for everyone involved.

_**Note:** These guidelines are adapted from [issue-guidelines](https://github.com/necolas/issue-guidelines)._


## Using the issue tracker

The [issue tracker](https://github.com/techstreams/TSFormTranslator/issues) is the preferred channel for [bug reports](#bug-reports), [features requests](#feature-requests) and [submitting pull requests](#pull-requests).


## Bug reports

A bug is a *demonstrable problem* that is caused by the code in the repository. Good bug reports are extremely helpful &mdash; thank you!

Guidelines for bug reports:

1. **Use the [GitHub issue search](https://github.com/techstreams/TSFormTranslator/search?type=Issues)** &mdash; check if the issue has already been reported.

2. **Check if the bug has already been fixed** &mdash; try to reproduce it using the repository's latest `master` changes.

3. **Include Pertinent Details** &mdash; include any details which will aid in solving the problem.  This includes such items as steps to reproduce the bug, screenshots showing the issue and browser/OS version.  Ideally include lines of code that you have identified as causing the bug.

Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report. What is your environment? What steps will reproduce the issue? What browser(s) and OS experience the problem?  What outcome did you expect and how did it differ from what you actually saw? All these details will help the project owner fix any potential bugs.

Example:

> Short and descriptive example bug report title
>
> A summary of the issue and the browser/OS environment in which it occurs. If
> possible, include the steps required to reproduce the bug.
>
> 1. This is the first step
> 2. This is the second step
> 3. Further steps, etc.
>
>
> Any other information you want to share which is relevant to the issue being reported. 
> This might include screenshots showing the problem, lines of code that you have
> identified as causing the bug and potential solutions.

**Note:** In an effort to keep open issues manageable, the project owner will close any issues that do not provide enough information to be able to work on a solution. You will be encouraged to provide the necessary details, after which the issue will be reopened.


## Feature requests

Feature requests are welcome but please take a moment to find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. It is dependent upon you to make a strong case to convince the project owner of the merits of the feature request. Please provide as much detail and context as possible.


## Pull requests

Good pull requests - patches, improvements, new features - are a fantastic help. They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated commits.

**Please ask first** before embarking on any significant pull request (e.g. implementing features, refactoring code, porting to a different language), otherwise you risk spending a lot of time working on something that the project owner might not want to merge into the project.

Please adhere to the coding conventions used throughout the project (indentation, accurate comments, etc.) and test your code.  See the [Developer Notes](README.md#developer-notes) for more information.

Follow the [Github Pull Request Documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) to create a pull request.

**IMPORTANT**: By submitting a patch, you agree to allow the project owner to license your work under the [Apache License, Version 2.0](LICENSE) used by the project.
